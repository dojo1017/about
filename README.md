# The PokemonGO Open Data Innitiative

## What Is It?

In laymans terms, it's an ethos, a goal, and a project, with which we aim to gather as much data as we can surrounding Pokemon GO and expose this data as an open API for all to use, whilst building a metadata database on top of it as well.

## Why Another Data Gathering Project?

There is no other data gathering project that aims to expose all data gathered in the way that we do.

## How Will It Work?

The project aims to release a minimal viable product of an open source PokemonGO data node that allows anyone to submit and query PokemonGO related information via open APIs.
