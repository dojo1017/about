# The PokemonGO Open Data Innitiative

## What Is PKMNGO-ODI?

In laymans terms, it's an ethos, a goal, and a project, with which we aim to gather as much data as we can surrounding PokemonGO and expose this data as an open API for all to use, whilst building a metadata database on top of it and exposing all the tools, frameworks and infrastructure that we use and create.

## Why Another Data Gathering Project?

Right now we're concerned that with all the reverse engineering we will be effectively violating numerous term's of service and Niantic will (rightfully) lock us out without an API.
We want to gather as much data as possible, whilst open sourcing all the tools, frameworks, and infrastructure used to gather it.
People can then do whatever they like with the data, and the possibilities are endless.

## How Will It Work?

We will first build tools and infrastructure in order to assist us with data gathering, then we'll be rolling this into a framework and multiple dumps of data that all can use and access.
Think of it as a big data, peer-to-peer experiment. Quite fun right???

## This Seems Exciting How Do I Help Out?

Right now, we're still building the tools we need to make this happen, please create an issue here expressing your interest and what you want to donate to the project, and we'll have a look as soon as we can.
